		<h2>Significant Lyrics</h2>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
				</br>I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
				</br>Suicidal, same time I'm tame
				</br>Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
				</br>Girl that you fucked with killed herself
				</br>That was this summer when nobody helped
				</br>And ever since then, man, I hate myself
				</br>Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation">
				<i>( Jocelyn Flores | 17 )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Arugably one of X's most popular songs, it's named after a close friend of his who committed suicide. In addition to this, he was
				</br>also dealing with the allegations of assaulting his ex, Geneva Ayala, so he was in a rough spot for the past couple of years.
				</br>This death affected  him severely because she was suicidal and depressed for so long and he didn't do anything to help her out; he felt powerless. 
				</br>X tells people to make sure that if they see a family or friend showing signs of depression and/or suicide, that they should provide
				</br>as much help and support as possible otherwise something bad could happen later on, and there will be no way to reverse the outcome.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
				</br>You're changing, I can't stand it
				</br>My heart can't take this damage
				</br>And the way I feel, can't stand it
				</br>Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
				</br>You're changing, I can't stand it
				</br>My heart can't take this damage
				</br>And the way I feel, can't stand it
				</br>Mmm, baby, I don't understand it "</i>
			</p>

			<p>There's a chance that X is talking about his ex Geneva. In many songs he claims that she broke his heart and gave him fake love.
				</br>But the real complication begins to emerge when he confirms that he still has feelings for her. This predicament is truly a painful
				</br>experience because he still loves this girl despite all of the pain she's done to him. He is placed into a confused state where he 
				</br>does not know what to do.
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" And the love in my heart is a cancer
				</br>And I spread it through the wall as an answer
				</br>To the cries of the dead and the vanquished
				</br>The depressed and the lost and the damned, it's
				</br>Preservation of the peace, an ideal world ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( Guardian Angel | SKINS )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>As cancer spreads rapidly in a person's body and feels unstoppable, X says his music has a similar affect, but instead of spreading
				</br>something dangerous and evil, instead it's love. With SKINS being his first posthumous album, a video emerged where many fans gave 
				</br>credit to him for his music saving them as well as being a role model for them to look up to.
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Drownin' in all my regrets
				</br>All just the same in the end
				</br>Over and over again (Again)
				</br>All that we do is pretend (All that we do is pretend)
				</br>Drownin' in all my regrets
				</br>All just the same in the end (Just the same)
				</br>Over and over again
				</br>All that we do is pretend "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( LIMBO ft. Killstation | Bad Vibes Forever )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>X once again elludes to the relationship issues he's dealt with as well as constantly going to jail. All of these actions made him 
				</br>regret his own actions. He has these feelings presented to him in an endless cycle of pain.
