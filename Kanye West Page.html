		<h2>Significant Lyrics</h2>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Good morning and look at the valedictorian
				</br>Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
				</br>Scared to face the world, complacent career student
				</br>Some people graduate, but be still stupid
				</br>They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
				</br>Just peep this, preach this, teach us, Jesus
				</br>Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
				</br>After all of that you received this "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation">
				<i>( Good Morning | Graduation )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Kanye asserts that most of the time, the valedictorian in a class is not the smartest kid; they may be smart academically 
				</br>but not street smart. I personally had a feeling similar to this when giving my speech as salutatorian because I knew I wasn't 
				</br>the smartest, I was just up there because I was one of the only people to work so hard to achieve this high position. To add, 
				</br>Kanye argues that schools nowadays do not let students express their creativites and go their own paths, the system is designed 
				</br>to make people follow identical, if not the same, paths in life which leads to a homogeneous-like society.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" I am a God
				</br>Hurry up with my damn massage
				</br>Hurry up with my damn ménage
				</br>Get the Porsche out the damn garage... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( I Am a God | Yeezus )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>The tone that Kanye presents while saying these lyrics presents the assumption that he doesn't sound so enthusiastic about the rich 
				</br>lifestyle. There have been instances of rich people feeling bored because they can theoretically get and have access to whatever they want.
				</br>A lot of the average people in society may find this hard to believe because they most likely never had such a consistent access to so much
				</br>money like Kanye and other rich people. It doesn't sound farfetched to think rich people may get depressed after finally being able to get
				</br>whatever they want because now there isn't much to strive for anymore.
			</p>

			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Mama passed in Hollywood
				</br>If you ask, lost my soul "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( Pt.2 | The Life of Pablo )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Kanye's mother, Donda, passed away in LA due to issues in a cosmetic surgery and it's believe she got this due to the social pressure that LA
				</br>exerts on people. Ever since then, Kanye hasn't been the same; he isn't the "old Kanye" anymore. To add, his music hasn't been the same since
				</br>he began using much more eerie, ominous, and out-of-character sounds in his music. A couple years after this album's release, Kanye releases
				</br>his latest album at the time, Donda, named after his mother.
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" ...The devil my opp, can't pay me to stop (It's lit) ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( Praise God ft. Travis Scott and Baby Keem | Donda )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>It's extremely obvious that Kanye is Christian and is devoted to his religion as he constantly talks about God, being a man of God, being 
				</br>God himself, and so on. In the Bible, the devil is depicted to be a being of temptation, luring people to commit sin. Since Kanye is a man
				</br>of God, the devil is his "opp", or opposition. Kanye has puttin his complete trust in God and would never go to the devil's side.
