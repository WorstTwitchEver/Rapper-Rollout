		<h2>Significant Lyrics</h2>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
        </br>Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
        </br>Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
    		</br>Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
				</br>It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
				</br>Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation">
				<i>( Shenrane a.k.a. Master Splinter's Daughter | good kid, m.A.A.d city )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>When Kendrick was first talking to this girl named Sherane, who might be a fictional representation of his significant other, Whitney Alford, he 
				</br>only had sexual feelings for her. This doesn't sound out of the ordinary because when first talking to someone, you'll almost always judge them
				</br>from their physical appearances. Because it was a girl, Kendrick was focused on just having sexual intercourse with her. But as people keep on 
				</br>talking, the perception of only seeing appearance somewhat fades away and the interest of personality comes into fruition. Kendrick started to love 
				</br>this girl's personality and was hoping that he'd marry her.
			</br>
			</br>
			But of course, being a black youth and living in Compton, he'd still have sex with her regardless whether he loves her or not. Compton is an area concentrated
			</br>on aggressive and immature behavior due to the music and violence that'd occur.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Hard times like, "Yah!"
			</br>Bad trips like, "Yah!"
			</br>Nazareth
			</br>I'm fucked up, homie, you fucked up
			</br>But if God got us, then we gon' be alright
			</br>
			</br>
			</br>N***a, we gon' be alright
			</br>N***a, we gon' be alright
			</br>We gon' be alright
			</br>Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
			</br>N***a, we gon' be alright
			</br>Huh? We gon' be alright
			</br>N***a, we gon' be alright
			</br>Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( Alright | To Pimp a Butterfly )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Kendrick believes we'all all be good if God has us by his side as well as having true faith towards Him. The lyrics provide a sense of optimism
				</br>and hope to the listener, alas to the dreadful things happening in the world. These lyrics were shouted repeatedly in Black Lives Matter rallies
				</br>to express that justice will be enforced soon. Kendrick drops the word "Nazareth" as a comparison to his hometown Compton because both places were known
				</br>for housing foul behaviors and people. Since Jesus allegedly grew up there, Kendrick compares himself to Jesus here where two great individuals were 
				</br>raised in a non-prosperous area.
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" ... then I heard
				</br>'What have you did for me'
				</br>I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
				</br>That dated back to June 17th, 1987
				</br>My paperwork was like a receipt
				</br>I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
				</br>But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
				</br>Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( untitled 01 | 08.19.2014. , untitled unmastered. )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>This entire song alludes to the Book of Revelations in the Bible stating that if the human race continues to sin, judgment day will happen. 
				</br>According to Revelations, 7 seals will be broken by a lamb, presumably the Lamb of God, and right after, 7 trumpets will play one by one.
				</br>Each trumpet represents a gruesome stage, becoming worse than the previous. Three monsters then come to cause even more destruction and the
				</br>event ends with 7 bowls being poured onto the earth, causing all sorts of catastrophe. Eventually, all dangers are sealed and Jesus rules
				</br>for 1,000 years. A thousand years pass and Satan and the others are released, only to be casted by fire and finally rid of. After this, a
				</br>place called "The New Jerusalem" will be made, which is a solid gold cube vasting many many miles. God, Jesus, all of the good humans, and
				</br>the multiple eyed angels will live in harmony.
			</br>
			</br>
				In the lyrics themselves, Kendrick hopes that he'll be able to enter Heaven because he is the "valedictorian" of the rap game; the greatest.
				</br>Next, he was a straight A student. Finally, he fears God for the unimaginative power He holds, which is common with many other people who
				</br>believe in God. 
			</p>

			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Bitch, be humble ( Hol' up, bitch )
				</br>Sit down ( Hol' up, lil’, hol’ up, lil' bitch )
				</br>Be humble ( Hol’ up, bitch )
				</br>Sit down ( Hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch )
				</br>Be humble  (Hol’ up, hol' up) ) ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( HUMBLE. | DAMN. )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Kendrick claims this chorus is directed towards himself, letting himself know to drop the ego. It can also be assumed that Kendrick is asserting
			</br>this statement to his competition in the rap game. In the music video, Kendrick is shown to be saying this to the other people around him at the table.
