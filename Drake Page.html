		<h2>Significant Lyrics</h2>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Cups of the rosé
				</br>Bitches in my old phone
				</br>I should call one and go home
				</br>I've been in this club too long
				</br>The woman that I would try
				</br>Is happy with a good guy
				</br>But I've been drinkin' so much
				</br>That I'ma call her anyway and say ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation">
				<i>( Marvins Room | Take Care )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>The beginning to the popular sad song "Marvin's Room" by Drake. Drake is portraying himself 
				</br>as being down bad claiming that he's better than any person his ex has hooked up with. He sings 
				</br>this song in an intoxicated tone, looking back at the past that he had with his ex.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" You used to call me on my cell phone
				</br>Late-night when you need my love
				</br>Call me on my cell phone
				</br>Late-night when you need my love 
				</br>And I know when that hotline bling
				</br>That can only mean one thing
				</br>I know when that hotline bling
				</br>That can only mean one thing "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( Hotline Bling | Views )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Even the most well known celebs were just average people before the glory (unless they had
				</br>connections lol). In this case, Drake was just a regular guy in Toronto living in the suburbs
				</br>and had a girl who liked him. But it ended tragically when she stopped giving him attention once
				</br>his career kicked off. Interestingly enough, the word "bling" is being used to represent the sound
				</br>a phone makes when it rings. It looks to make sense because the words "bling" and "ring" do rhyme.
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Might go down a G.O.D. ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( God's Plan | Scorpion )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>It's no surprise that Drake's influence is historic, to the point where he himself believes he'll
			</br>go down in history as a God, or at least a person remembered as one of the most famous people
			</br>in human history. To some people this may seem like something ego-centric to say, but he really
			</br>has been in the game for so long dropping bangers and many songs with replayable and catchy lyrics.
