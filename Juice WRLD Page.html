		<h2>Significant Lyrics</h2>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" I still see your shadows in my room
        </br>Can't take back the love that I gave you
        </br>It's to the point where I love and I hate you ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation">
				<i>( Lucid Dreams | Goodbye and Good Riddance )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>"Lucid Dreams" is undoubtedly the most popular song to come from Juice, it would be played and sung everywhere
        </br>by everyone, and years later it got a remix with the artist Lil Uzi Vert. The shadows refer to figures people
        </br>see during sleep paralysis and in the end, Juice represents the line "It's to the point where I love and I hate you ..."
        </br>with friends, family member(s), your relationship partner, or anyone close, as people you hate due to their behavior but 
        </br>still show love to them because they're still family at the end of the day. After being around them for so long, it's hard 
        </br>to completely get rid of them in your life.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
        </br>Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( Fine China | WRLD on Drugs )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Juice calls his girl "Fine China", which is a ceramic material that is beautiful and expensive. It's something that is only
        </br>used for very special occasions because of its extreme quality, compared to the average plates that people use to eat 
        </br>their meals on. 
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Fuck you in the Prada, poke her face like Lady Gaga
				</br>Ride it like a Mazda, zoom, zoom, zoom "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( Flaws and Sins | Death Race for Love )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>If you don't know already, Prada is a luxury designer brand and Juice asserts that his girl will be decked in Prada, even during
				</br>sexual intercourse. "poke her face like Lady Gaga" is a play on words to Lady Gaga's famous song "Poker Face". Finally, the last 
				</br>part has 2 meanings, to where he says he'll ride his girl like he's riding in a Mazda, and ends it off with "zoom zoom zoom" because 
				</br>slogan for Mazda's brand is "zoom zoom". Later in his posthumous album "Legends Never Die", he mentions Prada again in the song
				</br>"Up Up and Away" (my personaly favorite on the album).
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Cupid did a drive-by, shot me from the sunroof
				</br>Hit a n***a ten times, Gucci shirt, I bled through
				</br>Stains, stains, stains, stains, there's blood in the rain
				</br>Shame, shame, shame, shame
				</br>He used my chest as a firing range "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( Screw Juice | Legends Never Die )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Juice throws a twist on Cupid and says that he's destroyed him because he made him fall in love. The mythology of Cupid is that
			</br>he's the Roman God of Love who can make people fall in love with others instantly by shooting them with his arrows. This can also be
			</br>remembered in Dro Kenji's song "KILL CUPID" ft. $NOT as well as reminisced in the song "Who Shot Cupid?" in the "Death Race for Love" album.
