		<h2>Significant Lyrics</h2>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Yeah, it do not matter
				</br>Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
				</br>Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder ...
				</br>... Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
				</br>Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
				</br>Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder ...
				</br>... Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster ... "</i>
			</p>

				<i>( Money Longer | LUV vs The World )</i>

			<p>Uzi is worry free since now he can enjoy all of the valuables he's earned from the work he's done within his rap career: money, cars,
				</br>women, and drugs. People who have a SES, or a low socio-economic level status, always have to worry about the bills being paid and getting
				</br>access to food and water. But once a person has past that worry, there isn't many things that'll bother them. 
			</p>
			</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Lil Uzi Vert like who the fuck are you? (Yeah), yeah ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( Sideline Watching ( Hold Up ) | The Perfect LUV Tape )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Uzi sarcastically says this line to mock his haters for sleeping on him. Now, he's a pretty well known person in the rap game with over
				</br>20 million monthly listeners on Spotify ( November, 2021 ).
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (Yeah)
				</br>You'll find another life to live (Yeah)
				</br>I swear that you'll get over it
				</br>I know you're sad and tired
				</br>You've got nothing left to give (Yeah)
				</br>You'll find another life to live (Yeah)
				</br>I know that you'll get over it (Yeah) "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( The Way Life Goes ft. Oh Wonder | LUV is Rage 2 )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Many people can find comfort to these lyrics that Uzi is speaking because it's as if he's consoling his listeners, telling them that 
				</br>they'll move on from their struggles in life sooner or later. In this song, he melodically raps in a sad tone due to his breakup with
				</br>his ex Brittany Byrd. Breakups are tough for everyone to deal with and it'll be painful at first but Uzi urges for these people to stay 
				</br>strong and endure it because it'll be fine at the end.
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" I don't really care 'cause I'm done
				</br>On the real, our love is not fun
				</br>There's no emotion on my face 'cause I'm numb ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( P2 | Eternal Atake )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Uzi is using the same beat and flow that he used on arguably his most famous song, XO TOUR Llif3, which was released back in 2017.
				</br>Many fans ( including me ) were expecting the lyrics "I don't really care if you cry ..." but instead he switched it up to something
				</br>else. It definitely took fans ( including me ) quite some time to get used to the change. Similar to the lyrics presented in
				</br>"The Way Life Goes", Uzi is once again talking about Britney. To add, XO Tour Llif3 was also referring to Britney.
