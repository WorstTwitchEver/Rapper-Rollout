		<h2>Significant Lyrics</h2>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Save me before I dissipate, baby (Before I dissipate, baby)
			</br>All these thots done broke my heart, don't you participate, baby ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation">
				<i>( SAVE ME | Tears and Pistols )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Throughout this track, Dro expresses how he feels about his emotions and relationship
				</br>issues. He's asking the girl he loves to not do him dirty and break and his heart like 
				</br>the other girls that he's interacted with in his life.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" ... I can't even see thе numbers, all the Fiji in this Tech
				</br>I'll go all the way to outer space and back just for a check
				</br>And don't you let me down, I smoke a lot, yeah, I'm a vet
				</br>I'm aimin' at your crown, I keep some hollows in this TEC "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( UP! | RACE ME TO HELL )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Common behavior with rappers nowadays, Dro is flexing the wealth, jewellery, and girls that
				</br>he's acculumated while being in the rap game.
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" She way up here, we walkin' on a cloud
				</br>I'll walk off a cliff for a bitch that would try to drag me down ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( KILL CUPID ft. $NOT | EAT YOUR HEART OUT )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Another song where Dro explains his relationship issues but this time he bounces
				</br>it off with $NOT since it's a collab between the two. Guys showing loyalty to girls
				</br>who show acts of betrayal and sabatoge can happen and it sucks. This can literally be shown
				</br>in the animated music video of the single where he runs off of a cliff from a girl
			</br>he's fallen in love with who turned into a beast due to the destructive behavior of Cupid.
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Grrah, grrah, lil' pussy ass bitch
			</br>I got rich all by myself and I ain't never need a bitch, n***a
			</br>I just took a twenty out and spent it on her tits, n***a
			</br>My new bitch a model whore, so you can see her nips, n***a
			</br>Smokin' with this OnlyFans whore, gettin' blitzed, n***a "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( IM RICH NOW BITCH | FU*K YOUR FEELINGS )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>In terms of having barely any features, it's an accurate statement. Managing to get rich by 
			</br>yourself is an incredible flex and not many people may be able to pull something like that off.
			</br>Further on he once again flexes the things he's able to have from being rich.
