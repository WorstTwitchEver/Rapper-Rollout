		<h2>Significant Lyrics</h2>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
				</br>For real
				</br>You the only father that I ever knew
				</br>I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you ... "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation">
				<i>( No Role Modelz | 2014 Forest Hills Drive )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Uncle Phil is a character in the show "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" played by
				</br>James Avery who died on December 31st, 2013, one year before the song's release.
				</br>To Cole, he was his father-figure; the person he looked up to because he didn't 
				</br>have anyone to look up to, and promises he'll do better than he did for him growing up.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Spiralin' up, just like a rich n***a staircase (Spiral up)
				</br>No fly zone, please stay the fuck out my airspace (Out my face)
				</br>N***as say things behind backs that they wouldn't dare say (Dare say)
				</br>Know it's on sight when I see you, I'm workin' at Squarespace "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( m y . l i f e ft. 21 Savage and Morray | The Off Season )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>J Cole pokes fun at the rich people who got rich because they were born into a rich family.
			</br>They didn't have to struggle and take on challenges like him and instead of being able to 
			</br>take shortcuts. Because Cole is so prominent, he advises others to not be in his lane otherwise
			</br>he'll shoot them down. Hard. On the last part he makes a bar about SquareSpace, something I will
			</br>personally use for my Design 1 portfolio project :)
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" 1985, I arrived
				</br>33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
				</br>We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
				</br>Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( 1985 | KOD )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>At the time of this album being released, Cole was 33 years old. Due to racial discrimination, 
			</br>abusing various drugs, and participating in gang violence, many black men don't see the light of day 
			</br>past 25 years old. Cole shows gratitude for this because even he didn't know that he'd still be alive. 
			</p>
		</br>
			<p class="lyrics"><i>" Power, greed
				</br>Money, Molly, weed
				</br>Percs, Xannys, lean, fame
				</br>And the strongest drug of them all
				</br>And the strongest drug of them all
				</br>Love "</i>
			</p>
			<p class="citation"><i>( KOD | KOD )</i>
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>Cole lists off various addictive substances which makes sense because of what the cover art depicts
				</br>(kids doing drugs), the content within the songs itself, and even the release date of the album which was
				</br>on 4/20, a day that's culturally known for smoking weed. Each of the words spoken describe
				</br>each song's main tone.
