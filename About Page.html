      <h1>The Rationale of Rapper Rollout</h1>
      <p><b>Rapper Rollout</b> is a "for-fun" project made by Daljit Liyal showcasing his admiration for rap artists. It's also made for other people to see their
        </br>favorite artists and for people to discover these artists.The black, white, yellow, and purple color palette was thought to give a youthful, modern, 
    		</br>and playful aesthetic. The logo, favicon, and illustrations of each rapper were all designed by Daljit. <b>Genius</b> was used for showcasing the
				</br>album art as well as being a valuable source for all of the lyrical content picked in this project. (Of course, Genius is the way to go to understand
        </br>lyrical content, but on Rapper Rollout it's just a quick way of getting the jist of things.) Hochelga's video "Survival Guide to the Biblical Apocalypse"
        </br>on YouTube going in-depth with the explanation of the judgement day (see Kendrick Lamar's page for more context). Also major props to my brother Harjit
        </br>for helping me make my visual ideas come to fruition through the help of coding.

			<h2>Why Only 8 Artists?</h2>
			<p>Is what you might be asking... Ok, look: Rapper Rollout was originally intended to only showcase 8 artists, however, it was definitely thought of during
			</br>the conceputalizing phase to include more. Other artists like <i>Playboi Carti</i>, <i>The Kid LAROI</i>, <i>Lil Tecca</i>, <i>Young Thug</i>, <i>NAV</i>, 
			</br><i>Ian Diorr</i>, <i>24kGolden</i>, and even more were thought of to join the roster, but with the time it takes to finish just one artist's section, time
		</br>restraints have played a huge factor in this project. But in conclusion, I hope the person reading this has enjoyed the <b>Rapper Rollout</b> project!
